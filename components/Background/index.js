    Fermin Guerrero's visual communication practice focusing on
    Graphic and Typeface Design. In 2010, after he finished his
    bachelor in Industrial Design at Escuela Universitaria Centro de
    Diseño - Uruguay, Fermin Guerrero moved to Switzerland to study
    Visual Communication at the Haute École d’Art et de Design (HEAD)
    - Geneva, where he received his BA with first class honours. He
    subsequently went on to complete a Masters in Typeface Design at
    the University of Reading–UK, receiving his MA with Distinction in
    September 2015. Fermin has worked as an independent designer for
    more than 13 years, having won several prestigious prizes and
    commission for reknown international clients. His work has been
    featured in the most relevant international press. His curiosity,
    which has led him to move to out of his country in the quest for
    personal and professional development, keeps him constantly
    searching for new ways to express his ideas. He is currently based
    in the UAE, since 2018, where he has been appointed the Senior
    Graphic Designer.
